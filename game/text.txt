[Elijah Neutral] "No matter. We are leaving for the Demon Queen's castle tomorrow. I won't be seeing her for a while... Maybe she'll calm down in the meantime."
[Celeste Surprised] "You're coming with us?"
[Elijah Happy] "Of course. I'm a combat priest, I'm trained in healing all manner of battle wounds. My friend and I, Mark, will be your healers on this journey."
I'm happy he's coming with us. The priests are often very solemn and serious yet Sir Elijah is quite the opposite. He'll be a fun companion to have around-
Should I want to have fun on such an important journey though? Oh well. No one needs to know what I'm thinking.
[Celeste Happy] "I'll be happy to have you as part of our team."
[Elijah Happy] "Hey, you smiled! Thank the Goddess!"
I look at Sir Elijah surprised.
[Elijah Sad] "And... it's gone..."
I sigh. It might be fun, but maybe it won't be so easy to have him around after all.
